# Hospital_System_Database
This project simulates the use of an information system in the hospital, which consists of paper-based documents and small independent databases developed by several departments.

The hospital depends primarily on four groups of people: employees, physicians, patients, and volunteers. Of course, some common attributes are shared by all of these groups: person_ID (identifier), name, address, birth date, and phone number. Each group also has at least one unique attribute of its own. Employees have a date hired, volunteers have a skill, physicians have a specialty and a pager number, and patients have a contact date (date of the first contact with the hospital). Some people may belong to two or more of these groups at a given time.
